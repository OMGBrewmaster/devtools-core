#
# Deliberately OUTSIDE build/. Everything in build/ is COPYed into images and runs at
# image-build time; this runs at RUNTIME, from the mounted devtools clone, so it reaches
# a container the moment a pointer moves rather than at the next rebuild. Baking it would
# freeze the update tool into the image whose contents it exists to update.
#
# Not wired into any startup hook, and not aliased. It is a thing a human runs, which is
# what makes the exit-code contract below safe.
#
# ── Exit code ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# 0 only when every harness ended `updated` or `already-current`. Non-zero when any
# harness is `failed` OR `unavailable` — "cannot be performed" is a failure to update,
# not a pass. An absent harness is a real finding here: this kit installs all three at
# build time, so a missing one means the container predates the multi-harness kit (or a
# build silently lost it), and the remedy is printed beside the result.
#
# ── It always visits all three ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# No `set -e` short-circuit around the per-harness work: a partial report is the failure
# mode this script exists to avoid. One harness failing must not hide the state of the
# other two, so each is run, classified, and recorded, and the verdict is computed at
# the end from the whole table.

# kit needs a line here — which tests/test-update-harnesses.sh asserts, so the pairing is
