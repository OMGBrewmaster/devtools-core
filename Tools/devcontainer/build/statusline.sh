# Name the repo the counts actually describe. `.workspace.repo.name` is the
# PROJECT repo, derived from project_dir — but branch/dirty/ahead are all read
# from current_dir, and in a workspace built out of submodules those are
# routinely different repos. Sitting in /workspace/devtools with
# project_dir=/workspace, row 1 rendered "hq ⎇ main ✎1" while the branch and that
# one modified file belonged to devtools. A label that names a different repo
# than its own numbers is worse than no label.
#
# Confirmed empirically: repo.name keys off project_dir, not cwd — the captured
# payload said "hq" while cwd was /workspace/devtools, itself a clone with its own
# origin remote. So the test is whether cwd's repo IS the project repo.
#
# Compare git TOPLEVELS, not raw paths. project_dir is where Claude Code was
# launched and is frequently a subdirectory of the repo, so `$TOPLEVEL != $PROJDIR`
# would call an ordinary `cd docs/` session "nested" and relabel it. Toplevels also
# arrive as resolved physical paths on both sides, which sidesteps symlinks.
#
# Inside a genuinely different repo, the directory name wins. Otherwise keep the
# payload's name: it is the repo's real name, which the directory need not match
# (this workspace clones OMGBrewmaster/hq into /workspace, so a basename would say
# "workspace"). Fall back to a basename only when the payload offers nothing —
# workspace.repo is absent entirely in a repo with no origin remote.

# ---- metered spend: the ONLY money on a Pro/Max plan ---------------------------
#
# On a subscription, plan usage costs nothing per token — so no dollar figure is
# shown in the normal case. Money appears only when usage credits are actually
# being spent, and this is the loudest thing on the line when it happens.
#
# Fast mode (`/fast`) is the door most people walk through without noticing: it
# "draws directly from usage credits, even if you have remaining usage on your
# plan ... charged at the fast mode rate from the first token" (Claude Code docs),
# and it PERSISTS ACROSS SESSIONS by default. The API stamps every message with
# usage.speed, so the transcript is an exact record of which tokens were billed.
#
# Fast-mode rates per MTok in/out, from code.claude.com/docs/en/fast-mode
# (checked 2026-07-26): Opus 5 = $10/$50, Opus 4.8 = $10/$50, flat across the full
# 1M window. Opus 4.7 = $30/$150 is kept for HISTORICAL transcripts only — fast
# mode on 4.7 was deprecated 2026-06-25 and removed 2026-07-24, and the API now
# rejects those requests outright. Cache multipliers on input: read 0.1x, 5m write
# 1.25x, 1h write 2.0x. Standard-speed messages are in-plan and cost nothing.
#
# Every rate is MATCHED EXPLICITLY and an unrecognized model is counted as
# unpriced, never defaulted. The old `else {i:10,o:50}` quietly applied 4.8's rate
# to every model it had never heard of — including any model released after the
# table was written — and rendered the guess as a definite-looking `~$12.34`. A
# figure whose whole job is to warn about real money must not be invented; when
# the rate is unknown, say so and show the exposure instead. Add a model here only
# with a cited rate, never by widening the fallback.
