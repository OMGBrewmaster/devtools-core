# Single source of truth for devcontainer configuration.
# Called during Docker build (COPY the directory + RUN this file). No runtime deps.
#
# This file is HARNESS-NEUTRAL. It does the container setup every project needs
# regardless of which coding assistant runs in it — git LFS filters, git config, the gh
# credential helper, the volume-workspace bootstrap hook — and then hands off to each
# harness-*.sh beside it. Anything specific to one coding harness belongs in that
# harness's file, never here.
#
# The split replaced a single Claude-only script. The README's "Harness scope:
# Claude-first by choice" section named the trigger for splitting it — a second harness
# self-hosting in these containers — and that trigger fired: Oh My Pi and Codex both
# run here now.
#
# Configures:
#   - Git LFS filter config (global, since no .git dir at build time)
#   - Git config (autocrlf, safe.directory, bind-mount stat handling) in the XDG
#     global file, leaving ~/.gitconfig free for the host copy (section 0)
#   - gh as git's credential helper for github.com HTTPS
#   - Volume-workspace auto-populate shell hook
#   - Every harness-*.sh in this directory (Claude Code, Oh My Pi, Codex)

# 0. Where this script's git settings go, and why not ~/.gitconfig.
#
# Everything below writes with `git config --global`, and the global file is
# redirected here to the XDG path. The reason is identity. A container learns who
# you are from the Dev Containers extension, which copies the HOST's ~/.gitconfig
# in on attach — and it declines to populate a ~/.gitconfig that already exists.
# A kit that wrote its settings there at image-build time left that copy nowhere
# to land, so containers came up with no user.name and no user.email and could
# not commit until someone configured them by hand.
#
# So the kit's settings live in ~/.config/git/config and ~/.gitconfig is left
# absent for the host copy. Both are global scope; git reads the XDG file first
# and ~/.gitconfig second, so on any key set in both, the HOST wins. That is the
# intended precedence — your machine's git preferences beat the kit's defaults —
# and core.checkStat / core.trustctime (section 2) are the two worth knowing
# about if a host gitconfig ever carries them.
#
# GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL is set explicitly rather than leaning on git's implicit rule
# (the XDG file is the write target only while ~/.gitconfig is absent) because
# this script is documented as safe to re-run live inside an attached container,
# where ~/.gitconfig DOES exist — the extension writes a credential helper into
# it on attach — and the implicit rule would put the kit's settings straight back
# into the file this arrangement keeps clear. The export dies with the script.

# 2. Git config. Contributor-neutral: the git identity is deliberately NOT set
# here — this kit ships in the public Workshop mirror, and a hard-coded
# maintainer identity is exactly the kind of personal default that must not.

# (section 2b); a public build stays anonymous and the user's first commit
# prompts for identity, which is the correct behavior for a contributor.

# honest conflict too. Set unconditionally rather than on detecting a bind mount:
# both are harmless on the volume-backed containers, which is cheaper than a

# sets DEVCONTAINER_OVERLAY_DIR); a live re-run from a private checkout finds
# the same directory as ../overlay beside this file. A public build has neither
# and skips the block.
#
# Git identity is NOT one of those defaults, in a private build either. Section
# 0 keeps ~/.gitconfig free so the Dev Containers extension can copy the HOST's
# identity in on attach; an overlay is sourced in-process here, so a
# `git config --global user.email` in one lands in the same XDG file every write
# above goes to, and on a host that carries no identity of its own that baked
# value is what every commit gets attributed to. Let the host supply it.

# 3. Wire gh in as git's credential helper for github.com HTTPS, so that

# not on PATH yet here. The helper is only invoked later, at fetch time, by
# which point gh and its token both exist. (`!gh ...` is resolved via PATH.)

# the kit today can trip this: every write above goes through GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL,
# sourced overlays included (they run in-process). It is here for the future edit
# that writes outside the export's reach — an explicit `--file ~/.gitconfig`, or
# a script run after the export goes out of scope.
#
# Only a build-time run can fail it. A live re-run inside an attached container
# finds ~/.gitconfig already present (the extension put a credential helper
# there) and is deliberately left alone.
