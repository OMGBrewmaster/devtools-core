# Tests for Tools/devcontainer/update-harnesses.sh — the one command that updates every
# coding harness the devcontainer kit installs.
#
# The contract, asserted here:
#   1. every harness current  → exit 0, each reported `already-current`;
#   2. a real update          → reported `updated`, distinct from already-current;
#   3. a MISSING harness      → `unavailable`, exit NON-ZERO, naming the harness;
#   4. a FAILING update       → `failed`, exit NON-ZERO, naming the harness;
#   5. one harness failing does not stop the run — all three are still reported;
#   6. it is safe to run repeatedly — a second run over the same state agrees;
#   7. an updater that prints an error but exits 0 is NOT reported as failed
#      (the exit code is the classifier, and this pins that choice down);
#   8. every build/harness-*.sh has a row in the updater's HARNESSES table.
#
# TESTS 3 and 4 are the ones that matter, and they are the acceptance criterion's
# "a failure case that would catch a missing harness rather than reporting a false
# success". An updater that visited three tools and exited 0 because the one it could
# not find was skipped is the decorative check docs/signal-hygiene.md is about: its pass
# state is reachable by the exact failure it exists to detect.
#
# TEST 8 is the pairing check. The install side (build/harness-*.sh) and the update side
# (this script's table) are two lists that must name the same harnesses, and nothing in
# the code makes them one — so a harness added to the kit and forgotten here would be
# installed at build time and silently never updated. Asserted rather than remembered.
#
# Everything runs against STUB binaries in a scratch HOME. Real updaters would need a
# network, would take minutes, and — for the failure cases — cannot be asked to fail on
# demand.
