# SessionStart hook: the Claude Code bridge to the harness-neutral session
# bootstrap at scripts/agent/session-start.sh.
#
# THIS FILE HOLDS NO BOOTSTRAP LOGIC. Everything that fetches, fast-forwards,
# initializes submodules, or reports pointer lag lives in the neutral script,
# which any harness — and any human, and CI — runs as a plain command:
#   bash scripts/agent/session-start.sh
# All this wrapper adds is the vendor-specific envelope Claude Code needs and
# no other harness understands. Splitting them is what keeps the bootstrap a
# surface every harness reaches rather than a Claude-only feature
# (<shared-tools mount>/docs/harness-agnostic-repos.md, surface 3).
#
# Canonical copy: <shared-tools mount>/docs/templates/cloud-sessions/session-start.sh —
# each project carries its own copy at .claude/hooks/session-start.sh, because
# a hook whose job includes initializing the shared-tools tree cannot live inside
# it.
# The copies are promised byte-for-byte identical; the drift guard lives in the
# neutral script (which always runs) and checks BOTH files every session.
#
# What the envelope carries, and why it cannot live in the neutral script:
#   - the JSON object itself: Claude Code parses a SessionStart hook's stdout
#     as JSON on exit 0. Plain lines are still shown as context, so a harness
#     running the neutral script directly loses nothing but the two fields
#     below.
#   - additionalContext: the neutral script's report, delivered to the session
#     exactly as its plain-text form would be.
#   - reloadSkills: a request to rebuild the skill registry AFTER this hook
#     completes and BEFORE the first user message. The registry is built once
#     from `.claude/skills/*`, and a per-skill symlink that dangled when it was
#     built stays unregistered for the whole session: populating the submodule
#     afterwards restores the files, never the slash commands
#     (observed 2026-07-29 — `/ship` answered `Unknown skill: ship` with its
#     SKILL.md readable on disk). Asking for the reload is the
#     documented remedy, and it is requested exactly when the neutral script
#     reports having initialized or re-synced a submodule — which it signals by
#     writing the marker file named in AGENT_BOOTSTRAP_RELOAD_MARKER. A session
#     that changed nothing asks for nothing.
#   - the environment translation: CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR -> AGENT_PROJECT_DIR, and
#     CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE -> AGENT_SESSION_EPHEMERAL. The neutral script names
#     the property (a disposable sandbox checkout); only this file knows which
#     vendor variable asserts it.
#
# Silence is still silence: with no report and no reload to request, nothing is
# printed at all. And if stdout ever fails to parse as JSON, Claude Code falls
# back to treating it as plain context text, so a malformed emission degrades
# to a visible report rather than a silent one.
#
# Wired in .claude/settings.json (SessionStart; see settings-hooks.json in the
# template directory).
